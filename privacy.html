Privacy Policy for AI Educational Assistant
Last Updated: August 15, 2025

Thank you for using the AI Educational Assistant ("the Service"), created by Derrick Musamali ("we," "us," or "our"). Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information is handled by our Service and why.

1. The Core Principle: Your Data is Yours
Our Service is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. We do not have user accounts, and we do not have a database to store your personal information or conversations.

2. Information Handled by the Service
To provide its functionality, the Service uses your browser's local storage to save the following information directly on your device:

API Keys: You provide your own API keys from third-party AI providers (like Google, OpenAI, etc.). These keys are required to communicate with the AI models. They are stored only in your browser's local storage and are sent directly from your browser to the AI provider's service. They are never transmitted to or stored by our servers.

Chat History: Your conversations with the AI assistants are saved in your browser's local storage to allow you to continue your work between sessions. This data is also stored only on your device.

Application Settings: Your preferences, such as the selected AI provider and model, are saved in local storage for your convenience.

3. Third-Party Services
AI Providers: When you send a message, the content of that message and your API key are sent directly to the third-party AI service you have selected (e.g., Google, OpenAI). Their use of your data is governed by their respective privacy policies. We are not responsible for the data practices of these third-party services.

Google Analytics: We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the Service is being used and how to improve it. This includes information like which features are most popular, how long users stay on the site, and general user demographics. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

4. Data Security
Because your sensitive data (API keys and chat history) is stored locally on your device, you are in control of it. We recommend clearing your browser's cache and local storage if you are using a shared or public computer.

5. Children's Privacy
This Service is intended for educators and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
