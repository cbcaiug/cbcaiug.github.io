                <h2 id="description">1. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>The AI Educational Assistant is a suite of tools that uses third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to assist educators. The Service requires user authentication via Firebase Authentication (email/password or Google sign-in) to access features.</p>
                <p><strong>User Accounts:</strong> Each registered user receives a quota of 20 free downloads and 50 free messages. These quotas are tracked in Cloud Firestore and sync across all devices.</p>
                <p><strong>Document Export:</strong> The "Save as Google Doc" feature allows users to export AI-generated content into a document. By using this feature, you acknowledge that the generated document will be stored on our Google Drive and may be used for service improvement purposes, as outlined in our <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> You acknowledge that AI-generated content can be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased. You must independently review and verify all content before use. We are not liable for any damages or losses arising from its use.</p>
                <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The Service relies on third-party AI providers and the Google Drive/Docs service. We do not control and are not responsible for the availability, performance, or security of these external services.</p>
                <p><strong>Consent to Document Storage:</strong> By using the "Save as Google Doc" feature, you consent to have the generated content stored and reviewed by us for the sole purpose of improving the Service's quality and performance, as detailed in our Privacy Policy.</p>
